The folder contains two simple games that I created at the beginning of my Python education.

- The first game is the classic Paper, Rock and Scissors game in which we specify how many points we want to play
- The second game is a 3-cup game in which we can play and virtual money.

Both games are text form and run in the console window.
I wish you lots of fun ;)
